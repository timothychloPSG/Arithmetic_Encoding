NOTES FOR TIM: 

Work on the IO for the encode and decode, 
which basically means taking the file, reading in byte by byte and then 
store the characters in an array, and make sure that you store the 
number referring to the file somewhere so that you can pass it to romeo 
for writing to in encode


the function cleanup will probably include the output file as well as the model
for its parameters. this will free the model, and it will also close the file, and
most likely that's about it for cleanup function within AR.h

make sure that you give romeo a uin32_t number that represents for decode, the 32 bits for each character that will be encoded in for the future
