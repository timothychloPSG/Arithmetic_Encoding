/*

Work on the IO for the encode and decode, 
which basically means taking the file, reading in byte by byte and then 
store the characters in an array, and make sure that you store the 
number referring to the file somewhere so that you can pass it to romeo 
for writing to in encode


the function cleanup will probably include the output file as well as the model
for its parameters. this will free the model, and it will also close the file
